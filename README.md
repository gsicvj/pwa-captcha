## TODO / Roadmap

Here's a look at what's planned for the future.

- [ ] Fix installation prompt. Mobile devices can't install the app. Self Signed TLS isn't secure. Dockerize and deploy. Try again.
- [ ] Properly handle sessions and subscriptions
- [ ] Implement captcha UI or maybe just click navigate to captcha
